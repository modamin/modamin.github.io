I am a Solution Architect specialized in designing, building, and deploying large scale enteprise cloud data platforms. I currently work on Data & AI at Microsoft. I share things I learn from my day to day engagements with Microsoft customers deloying products like Microsoft Fabric & Power BI, Microsoft Purview, Azure Databricks, and others. Posts here are my own opinions, not official Microsoft statements.
